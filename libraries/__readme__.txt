This folder holds all libraries ( linked through Install_Path: AutoHotKey\Lib\ ) so files that #include <lib> look here... This is a vital folder but the inclusion
of libraries is handled by AutoHotkey ( Coder only needs to include <xxxx> excluding extension for it to look in here ) so this folder isn't loaded by the autoloader.
