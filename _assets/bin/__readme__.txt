This folder houses important executables...

The following should be included:
	+ Windows SysInternals Utilities
		+ DebugView Folder
			- Dbgview.exe ( https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/debugview.aspx - Useful for reading logs )
			- Dbgview.chm

			Note: I, according to the EULA, may not make copies of the software but I can alter the setup.bat ( or the AutoHotkey variant which 
				is planned ) to automatically download the latest version and extract it...

			Download: https://download.sysinternals.com/files/DebugView.zip

	+ NirSoft NirCMD ( http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html )
		+ NirCmd_x86 or NirCmd_x64 Folder - Default in the framework is 64 although I may be able to automate which one is used later on..
			- nircmd.exe ( NirSoft Commandline Utility; incredibly useful and quicker to alter settings, etc.. )
			- nircmdc.exe ( Same as nircmd.exe except error-messages report to this command-window instead of opening a message / prompt )
			- nircmd.chm ( NirSoft Commandline Utility help file )

			Download x86: http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.zip

The following are optional:
