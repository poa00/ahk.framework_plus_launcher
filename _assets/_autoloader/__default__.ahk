;; Note: Do not alter this file unless absolutely necessary! This file is the start of the load-order file and will overwrite the load-order
;;	file each time the autoloader runs. Anything that needs to be altered should be done in the following files:
;;
;;		- AcecoolAHK_Framework\_assets\_autoloader\__default__.ahk
;;			Which is appended to this file when it becomes load_order.ahk BEFORE any files are added..
;;
;;		- AcecoolAHK_Framework\_assets\_autoloader\__default__.ahk
;;			Which is appended to this file when it becomes load_order.ahk AFTER everything has been added to it...
