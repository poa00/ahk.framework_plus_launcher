This folder links you to special folders and files...


Included Shortcuts:
	- Program Files \ AutoHotkey \ Lib
		This is the folder which contains your libraries ( "#include <name>", no quotes but with <>s, includes name.ahk from this folder ). When you
		run setup.bat, if this folder exists it'll be renamed ( uniquely each time ) so that the symbolic link to your Cloud AutoHotkey folder can
		be linked.

	- Useful Windows Shortcuts...

To be automatically created using the setup.bat file ( As Documents folder changes name based on language and per user ) at a later date:
	- My Documents\AutoHotkey.ahk
		This is the default AHK Script which is executed when you run AutoHotkey.exe - This will be backed up if it exists and overwritten with a new
		version which links AutoHotkey.exe to your Cloud AutoHotkey folder and Script Loader ( Full Loader ).
