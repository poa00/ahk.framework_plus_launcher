;; Processes / Jobs Readme - Josh 'Acecool' Moser
;;
This folder is for separate processes or jobs; these are never loaded in the autoloader as each file would be for an individual task ( such as the screenshot
window and create clickable notification which, on click, asks the user if they want to make the screenshot public or keep it private and depending on the
response will move the file or not, open the file, and copy the public link if moved to public folder and if using DropBox ).. As these tasks may use other
framework files, the base framework may be used in conjunction with these tasks ( base framework doesn't load hotkeys or anything else which may interfere with
normal operation of scripts and hotkeys )...
